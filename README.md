Loan Prediction Machine Learning Model

Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval status based on customer information such as income, credit history, and loan amount. By leveraging machine learning models, this system helps financial institutions streamline the loan approval process. The primary focus of the project is to build a robust predictive model using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

Key Steps

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	
 •	Analyze and visualize data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	
 •	Handle missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.

2. Data Preprocessing
	
 •	One-hot encode categorical variables.
	
 •	Scale numerical features.
	
 •	Split data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training

Trained various machine learning models, including:
